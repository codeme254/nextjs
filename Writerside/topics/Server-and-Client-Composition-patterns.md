# Server and Client Composition patterns

Server components are perfect for tasks such as:
- Fetching data
- Directly accessing backend resources
- Protecting sensitive information on the server (like access tokens and API keys)
- Keeping large dependencies server-side, which helps in reducing client-side JavaScript.

Client components are perfect for tasks such as:
- Adding interactivity
- Adding event listeners
- Managing state and lifecycle effects
- Using browser exclusive APIs
- Using custom hooks
- Using React Class components
