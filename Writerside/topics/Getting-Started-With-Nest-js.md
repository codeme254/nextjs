# Getting Started With Next.js

To generate a Next.js project, open your terminal/command prompt and run the following command:

```Bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```
The command uses the `create-next-app` utility to generate a next project for you.

If you don't have the `create-next-app` tool installed, you will be prompted to install it, accept the prompt.

You can also install the utility by running the command below:

```Bash
npm install create-next-app@latest
```

When you execute the command `npx create-next-app@latest`, the utility will run you through a series of questions
to automatically set up the project for you, answer them accordingly.

```Bash
cd hello-world
npm run dev
```
