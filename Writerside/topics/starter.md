# Introduction
Next.js is a React framework for building web applications.

It is a React framework that provides tools and features to build modern web applications efficiently.

It simplifies and enhances the development of React applications by adding functionality like server-side rendering 
(SSR), static site generation (SSG), API routes, and more.

Next.js is built by Vercel and is widely used for creating fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications.

Next.js is a fullstack framework meaning it can handle both front-end and back-end tasks in the same project.

## Key features of Next.js
1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Renders React components on the server and sends fully rendered HTML to the browser, 
improving SEO and reducing initial load time.
2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Generates static HTML pages at build time, making websites fast and suitable for 
content that doesn't change frequently.
3. **Incremental Static Generation**: Allows you to update static pages after the application is built, combining the 
benefits of static and dynamic pages.
4. **API Routes**: Enables you to create backend API endpoints directly in your Next.js project, removing the need 
for a separate server.
5. **File-Based Routing**: Automatically generates routes based on the file structure.
6. **Image Optimization**: Optimizes images on demand with the `next/image` component, reducing load times.
7. **Automatic Code Splitting**: Loads only the necessary JavaScript for each page, improving performance.
8. **Middleware and Edge functions**: Provides tools for intercepting requests and running logic at the edge, 
enabling fast and dynamic responses.

## Why do we need Next.js?
1. **Improved SEO**: SSR and SSG help ensure search engines can crawl your content effectively.
2. **Better performance**: Features like code splitting, image optimization, and static site generation make Next.js
apps fast.
3. **Full-Stack capabilities**: With API routes, you can handle backend logic directly in the same project, making 
Next.js suitable for full-stack applications.
4. **Simplified routing**: The file-based routing system eliminates the need to configure third party routers manually.
5. **Developers experience**: Built-in support for common requirements like styling, routing, and API handling 
reduces boilerplate and accelerates development.
